# Able

Able is a programming language. It is meant to be read easily. The aim of the Able is to be readable with even for the people how otherwise are completely mundane to programming languages.

## Installation

Not yet implemented. See [Status of development](#status-of-development)

## Main goals

The approach of the Able is to make as readable language as possible. This means that writing a new code will be considerably slower than conventional programming languages. However reading code enables a completely new ways to do collaborative coding. Also logical errors are more exposed to a larger audience thus it is easier to prevent critical errors and bugs earlier in the development process.

## Main ideas

The main ideas and concepts are mainly drawn from markup language [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). The aims of the Markdown and Able are very similar.

Able aims:

- to be [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) compliant
- to have minimal use of special characters
- to give a possibility to use natural language structure in definitions of the functions and variables
- to be effective and expressive programming language without compromising the readability

There's some relation to awesome projects such as [LiaScript](https://liascript.github.io/)

## Status of development

Able is currently in inital stages of development. Able was originally written in golang but then is being pivoted to c++. There's not much of a working language yet altough there's some basic parsing ready. However there's no runtime environment so nothing will happen.

Also there's prospective process of getting more ideas to achive the main goals better. This process consists planned workshops and and crowdsourcing.
